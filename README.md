## Overview

**Comical Adventure 2** is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript game dropped into a single file. It's bright, chaotic, and unapologetically silly. Guide the big cookie emoji around the screen, hoard more cookies, avoid bombs, nab speed boosts, and keep your distance from the cookie-thieving robot and the braaains-hungry zombie.

> Disclaimer: The comedic chaos might trigger sudden laughter or the uncontrollable urge to shout “💣 BOMBS AWAY!”

## Features

- **Cookie Overload**: Collect tasty cookies to rack up points. Delicious virtual sugar is the key to victory.
- **Bombs**: Dangerous and apparently unstable. Step on one and *KABOOM!* you’ll lose points. Consider them hot potatoes with explosive personalities.
- **Speed Bonus**: Grabbing a ⚡ power-up will have you zooming around the map in double-time. Who said cookies slow you down?
- **Robot Menace**: A sneaky robot that roams around, trying to snatch your precious cookie stash. Keep your distance or get robbed.
- **Zombie Pursuit**: Because every silly game needs a zombie. This one chases you around, intent on scoring some comedic nibble time (at your expense).
- **Crazy Mode**: Collect enough cookies or surpass certain scores, and the background goes... well, bananas. Rainbow havoc, here we come.

## Gameplay

Upon launching the HTML file:
1. You’ll see a *title screen* with a big red button.
2. Click the button to reveal the full HUD (heads-up display) containing:
   - **Time** (seconds elapsed since your comedic journey began).
   - **Score** (from collecting cookies and other oddities).
   - **Cookies** (the tastiest collectible of them all).
3. Your character (the giant cookie emoji) spawns in the middle.
4. **Move** around, pick up cookies, speed bonuses, and watch out for bombs.
5. A **robot** roams randomly, trying to steal your cookies if it collides with you.
6. A **zombie** hunts you relentlessly—every collision drains points.
7. Achieve a high enough score or collect enough cookies, and everything gets vividly insane under **Crazy Mode**.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**:
  - Move Up / Down / Left / Right
- **Click** on spawned items (cookies, bombs, bonuses) if you’re in an especially bold (or bored) mood:
  - Cookies: Gains points.
  - Bombs: Immediate explosive regret.
  - Bonus: Speed mania time.

Movement boundaries keep you within the screen. But remember, the walls can’t protect you from the zombie’s groaning or the robot’s cookie-thieving.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Speed Boost**: ⚡ When you see it, grab it. Good for outrunning the zombie, the robot, or your responsibilities. 
- **Avoid Bombs**: Exploding in your face is not good for your comedic reputation.
- **Keep Distance**: The robot doesn’t bite, but it’s definitely a cookie kleptomaniac.
- **Zombie**: The undead is hungry for giggles (and your points). Lure it away from cookie clusters if you can.
- **Crazy Mode**: Embrace the color overload if you’re scoring well. The more frantic it gets, the bigger your bragging rights.
